& \textit{Epigenetics crossover for multi-objective optimisation}

    % Analysed existing Evolutionary Computation algorithms
    % based on evolutionary concepts from the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis, and 
    % identified a gap in epigenetic inheritance.
    % A novel epigenetic blocking mechanism was then developed and a detailed benchmarking 
    % suite created to test and compare existing algorithms with the new
    % mechanism. Hyperparameter optimisation was further studied
    % find the best performing results on dynamic multi-objective optimisation
    % problems. The final results were applied to a real world voyage optimisation
    % problem to reduce fuel consumption and voyage times.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Analysed existing Evolutionary Computation algorithms
    based on evolutionary concepts from the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis, and 
    identified a gap in epigenetic inheritance.
    \item Developed a novel epigenetic blocking mechanism and created a detailed benchmarking 
    suite to test and compare existing algorithms with the new mechanism.
    \item Investigated the use of hyperparameter optimisation to find the best 
    performing results on dynamic multi-objective optimisation problems.
    \item Applied the final results to a real world voyage optimisation
    problem to reduce fuel consumption and voyage times of international shipping journeys.
    \end{itemize}
    % to determine their differences and suitability to a new epigenetic mechanism.
    % A novel epigenetic blocking mechanism based on gene regulation is
    % developed and tested on the identified algorithms. Performance on static
    % and dynamic multi-objective problems show the improvement the epigenetic mechanism
    % can make in dynamic optimisation, with improved performance across the 
    % duration of the optimisation process. Further study and comparison of the
    % hyperparameters indicate the mechanism is both problem and algorithm specific,
    % requiring different hyperparameters depending on the properties of a problem
    % to achieve the best performance.

%--------------------PROJECTS-----------------------------------
\section*{Previous projects}
% \textbf{Settlers of Catan} \textit{Junior Honours project} \\
% Year long team project to create a digital Settlers of Catan board game.
% Worked in a team of 4 where I was responsible for the backend and AI in Java.
% Participated in inter-team discussions for a communication protocol that allowed a game
% to be played over different implementations.

%\textbf{Unix file system} & Implemented a simple \texttt{POSIX} file system in C using unqlite key-value store for persistent storage. Features included a tree-structured directory hierarchy with sub-directories and file, directory and meta-data creation, update and deletion.\n

%\textbf{Multicast file distribution protocol} & Designed and implemented a protocol to reliably and efficiently replicate whole files on persistent storage across multiple nodes in C. Made design decisions regarding the use of UDP multicast and TCP control messages based on observations during initial deployment.\\

%\textbf{Reversi/Othello} & Implemented the Othello board game with Haskell in a team of 3.\\

\textbf{Dota 2 player prediction} \textit{MSci dissertation} \\
Used machine learning algorithms to predict the player behind the keyboard through 
behavioural features such as mouse movements and in-game decisions. Features were 
extracted and parsed from match replays, then clean and refined through a data pipeline.
Finally, the performance of different combinations of features and machine learning 
techniques were compared.
\\

\textbf{Graph matching with lobsters} \textit{BSc dissertation} \\
Applied computer vision algorithms from opencv on images of lobsters to represent their bodies as
attributed graphs by detecting points of interest. Graph matching techniques were then
used to discover and measure properties such as the lobster's size and maturity.
